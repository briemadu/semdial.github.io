Title: How do I cite publications in the ACL Anthology?
weight: 1
---

If available, you can you use Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).
The canonical URL for papers is given by appending the ACL ID to the Anthology URL, e.g., https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E91-1001
Both the DOIs and the persistent URLs embed the 8-character ACL Anthology Identifier.

You can use variations on the canonical URL to access [the paper page](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E91-1001) (by appending a `/`) or [the BibTeX file](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E91-1001.bib) (by appending `.bib`).
